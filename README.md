Responsive Web Layout Project

Features
1. Navigation Bars
The layout includes two distinct navigation bars:

Navbar 1 (Icons and Links): The topmost navbar features icons like social media and custom icons followed by anchor links for easy navigation across different pages.
Navbar 2 (Links + Authentication): The second navbar contains text-based links, such as "Home", "About", "Services", and "Contact", as well as Sign Up and Login buttons for user authentication.

2. Grid Layout

The main content is structured in a grid layout, utilizing CSS Grid or Flexbox to maintain a consistent and responsive design. This layout is ideal for presenting structured content such as text, images, and cards in a modern and organized way.

Mobile Optimization: The grid adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience on mobile devices by adjusting columns accordingly.

3. Image Overlay Effect
An image overlay effect has been applied to specific sections of the layout, giving a visually appealing hover effect that includes:

A semi-transparent layer on top of the image.
Text and buttons overlaid on the image, which can be useful for highlighting important content, promotions, or calls-to-action.

4. Containers and Cards
To present information cleanly, weâ€™ve utilized:

Containers: These are used to group sections of content and provide consistent spacing.
Cards: Beautifully designed cards are used to present individual items such as blog posts, services, or portfolio items. Each card contains an image, a heading, and some descriptive text.

5. Beautiful Footer
The footer has been designed with a sleek, modern style that includes:
Multiple columns for organizing various links (such as "About", "Services", "Privacy Policy", etc.).
Social media icons in the final column for quick access to social networks.
The footer is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across different device widths.
